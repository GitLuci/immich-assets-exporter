### You can run the tests file to check if you are able to access everything, is a simple way to test your permissions, can have some bug, anything let me know in the comments.
#
#
## Disclaimer
### Since the project is just starting this are the next steps : 
#### 1: Finish the v.0.1 and give the user permission to choose the local path to save the time_line_bucket and dowload it in a zip file ⌛
#
#
#
#
### The project is totally open source, can be used and cloned whatever you want, just give a star to my repository⭐

## This is an entire project written by a human, without AI Intervention. The Idea is study and practice research and code without AI.
#### Maybe copilot have written some commit descriptions... or Summary.... Well, maybe the AI had a 1% of participation :)
